# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) in C

This project implements the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** algorithm in C using **Dynamic Programming**.

The LCS problem is a classic algorithm problem used to find the longest subsequence common to two strings.

---

## What is LCS?

Given two sequences, the Longest Common Subsequence is the longest sequence that appears in both of them in the same order (not necessarily contiguous).

Example:

Input:
AGGTAB
GXTXAYB

Output:
4

The LCS is: **GTAB**

## Algorithm

This project uses **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to solve the LCS problem efficiently.

- Time Complexity: **O(m × n)**
- Space Complexity: **O(m × n)**

Where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings.

## How to Run

Compile the program:

```bash
gcc lcs.c -o lcs
